# BechdelTest 
(/bechÂ·del test/ n.) Known inplementation: Bechdel Test Movie Benchmark (also known as narrow Bechdel Test or weak Bechdel Test). The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on www.feministfrequency.com

# Weak Bechdel Test Movie Benchmark
1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

# Strong Bechdel Test (Personal)
1. In everyday life you need to have at least one women you communicate with
2. In any type of talks around you, where womens participate, time they speak need to be within the middle mathematical expectation of talk time variance for all interlocutors 
3. She need to talk about something besides a man

# General Bechdel Test (Population)
1. In .... you need to have at least one women you communicate with
2. In any type of talks around you, where womens participate, time they speak need to be within the middle mathematical expectation of talk time variance for all interlocutors 
3. She need to talk about something besides a man


# A Bechdel Test For Programmers

In order for a movie or television show to pass the Bechdel Test (named after cartoonist and MacArthur genius Alison Bechdel), it must feature two female characters, have those two characters talk to one another, and have those characters talk to one another about something other than a man. A lot of movies and shows don't pass. How would programming culture fare if subjected to a similar test? One tech firm, 18F, decided to find out after seeing a tweet from Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, which explained the parameters of a modified Bechdel Test. According to Voss, a project that passes the test must feature at least one function written by a woman developer, that calls a function written by another woman developer. 'The conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then raised a good point,' read 18F's blog posting on the experiment. 'She said some of our projects had lots of female devs, but did not pass the test as defined.' For example, some custom languages don't have functions, which means a project built using those languages would fail even if written by women. Nonetheless, both startups and larger companies could find the modified Bechdel Test a useful tool for opening up a discussion about gender balance within engineering and development teams.
