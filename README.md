# BechdelTest 

(/bech·del test/ n.) Known inplementation: Bechdel Test Movie Benchmark (also known as narrow Bechdel Test or weak Bechdel Test). The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on www.feministfrequency.com


# Weak Bechdel Test Movie Benchmark
1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

# Strong Bechdel Test (Personal)
1. In everyday life you need to have at least one women you communicate with
2. In any type of talks around you, where womens participate, time they speak need to be within the middle mathematical expectation of talk time variance for all interlocutors 
3. She need to talk about something besides a man

# General Bechdel Test (Population)
1. In .... you need to have at least one women you communicate with
2. In any type of talks around you, where womens participate, time they speak need to be within the middle mathematical expectation of talk time variance for all interlocutors 
3. She need to talk about something besides a man



# A Bechdel Test For Programmers

In order for a movie or television show to pass the Bechdel Test (named after cartoonist and MacArthur genius Alison Bechdel), it must feature two female characters, have those two characters talk to one another, and have those characters talk to one another about something other than a man. A lot of movies and shows don't pass. How would programming culture fare if subjected to a similar test? One tech firm, 18F, decided to find out after seeing a tweet from Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, which explained the parameters of a modified Bechdel Test. According to Voss, a project that passes the test must feature at least one function written by a woman developer, that calls a function written by another woman developer. 'The conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then raised a good point,' read 18F's blog posting on the experiment. 'She said some of our projects had lots of female devs, but did not pass the test as defined.' For example, some custom languages don't have functions, which means a project built using those languages would fail even if written by women. Nonetheless, both startups and larger companies could find the modified Bechdel Test a useful tool for opening up a discussion about gender balance within engineering and development teams.

In order for a movie or television show to pass the Bechdel Test (named after cartoonist and MacArthur genius Alison Bechdel), it must do three things:

Feature two female characters
Have those two characters talk to one another
Have those characters talk to one another about something other than a man
A lot of movies and shows don’t pass. How would programming culture fare if subjected to a similar test? One tech firm, 18F, decided to find out after seeing the above tweet from Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, which explained the parameters of a modified Bechdel Test. According to Voss, a project that passes the test must feature at least one function written by a woman developer, that calls a function written by another woman developer.

“The conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then raised a good point,” read 18F’s blog posting on the experiment. “She said some of our projects had lots of female devs, but did not pass the test as defined.” (Hat tip to ThinkProgress.org for the original link to the posting.) For example, some custom languages don’t have functions, which means a project built using those languages would fail even if written by women.

18F, which acts as the in-house digital delivery team for the federal government’s General Services Administration, used the test as a springboard for an internal discussion about diversity: “It only addresses gender: race, socio-economic status, disability, and others are important considerations when building successful, diverse teams.”

Nonetheless, both startups and larger companies could find the modified Bechdel Test a useful tool for opening up a discussion about gender balance within engineering and development teams.

The coding Bechdel test, as described above, is a variant of the original Bechdel test, which was created by writer and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel. The Bechdel test was originally designed to evaluate works of fiction. A work passed if at least one woman had a conversation with another woman about something other than a man.

The 18F team
We decided to see how many 18F projects pass this modified test. To pass, a project had to have at least one function written by a woman dev that called another function written by another woman dev.

Kaitlin posed the question to a group of 18F employees, which prompted a long conversation about our internal values and culture. The conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then raised a good point: She said some of our projects had lots of female devs, but did not pass the test as defined. 18f.gsa.gov, for example, uses a framework and language called SASS to generate the styles used on each page. The overwhelming majority of our custom SASS was written by a woman, and another woman wrote a significant amount of HTML that relies on that SASS, but because neither language has “functions” it fails the test.

The conversation also caused us to think about how we holistically evaluate our inclusivity as a team. There are also many roles on our product teams other than developers that are just as important to the success of a product. Visual designers, content designers, user experience researchers: all of these roles are critical to shipping a product. Is there another way of evaluating our teams that takes these roles into consideration? This test is also limited with respect to other protected classes. It only addresses gender: race, socio-economic status, disability, and others are important considerations when building successful, diverse teams.

Nevertheless, a “Bechdel Test for Code” is valuable because it addresses that tech as a whole has issues that it needs to surmount. Gender balance in engineering, therefore, needs to be acknowledged specifically even if this test isn’t the only way we measure inclusivity at 18F. It is a conversation we will continue to have at 18F to make sure we are building a team that looks like America and works like America. As our projects become Bechdel compliant, we plan to note the change.
